## Projects
1. Gaussian process emulator for the Greenland Ice Sheet (gp-emulator)
2. Image classification model (image-classification)
3. Linear regression model (linear-reg-model)


### Gaussian process emulator
In summer 2019, I worked on implementing a Gaussian process emulator with Dr. Andy Aschwanden at the University of Alaska Fairbanks to project sea level contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Dr. Aschwanden previously worked on a [geophysical model](https://github.com/pism/pism-gris) to estimate contribution, but it was very computationally expensive and did not have a good way to quantify uncertainty. The emulator was able to project contribution with a 0.52 root mean square deviation.

Included is a presentation that I gave at the American Geophysical Union. The plots were made using matplotlib in Python.


### Image classification model
This is a group project I worked on for a class in Automated Learning and Data Analysis this semester. My group members and I used the Caltech-256 dataset (over 30k images in 256 categories) and implemented various learning methods, specifically Naive Bayes, K-Means clustering, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

Included is the final report and implementation (with Python). The data set can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/caltech256).


### Linear regression model
This is a group project I completed for a Regression Analysis class as an undergraduate. My group members and I built a linear regression model to predict carbon dioxide emissions from various factors related to the environment, health, and development of a country. The data is from the World Bank.

Included is the final report, implementation (with R), and data set used.
